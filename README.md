## My process
  My approach was pretty simple and straight foward. 

  - I was going to use HTML5 and CSS
  - I first started by blocking out the entire page using HTML.
  - proved classes only were necessary

  -For CSS i utilized the style-guide proved to get the page looking as close to the reference as possible.
  - The goal was to make my page looking as close ass possible to the reference.
  
  - If you have better approach feel to make changes i would love to review and learn

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS 


### What I learned

Firstly after getting the challenge, i suddenly didn't know where to start from, this made me realise how much i need to spend more time practicing rather than watching tutorials, like i don't need to watch another HTML for bigginers tutorial.

I realized how things start working once you start the project.

I learnt how to work with tables

I learnt how to deploy a site on github pages



### Continued development

To be honest i want to continue practicing and improve in all areas.
 - I think I'm ok with html
 - i need to practice css
 - 

### Useful resources

- (https://www.w3schools.com)- Helped me on how to work with tables for my final section of the page.
